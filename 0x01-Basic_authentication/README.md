# Basic Authentication with Flask

## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing basic authentication to secure a Flask web application. It builds foundational skills for backend authentication, including the use of tokens, handling sessions, and ensuring access control for specific endpoints. By the end of this project, you will have a Flask app with secure access control mechanisms that can be extended for more advanced security measures.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:
- Understand the role of authentication in web applications.
- Implement basic authentication mechanisms.
- Manage user sessions and token-based authentication.
- Secure API endpoints using authentication.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Implement basic user authentication to protect routes.
- **Session Management**: Handle user sessions to maintain state across requests.
- **Access Control**: Secure specific endpoints based on user roles and permissions.
