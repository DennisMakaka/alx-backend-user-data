# User Authentication Service

## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating a user authentication service for a back-end application. The goal is to design and implement a system that securely manages user accounts, handles authentication, and ensures user data confidentiality and integrity. Key functionalities include user registration, login, password management, and session handling, all while adhering to best practices for security.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:
- Understand the fundamentals of user authentication.
- Learn how to securely store and manage passwords.
- Implement session management for logged-in users.
- Explore the use of tokens and cookies for maintaining authentication states.
- Gain experience in handling common authentication challenges, such as invalid login attempts or expired sessions.

## Concepts Covered
### User Authentication Basics
- User registration and validation.
- Password hashing and secure storage using tools like bcrypt.
- Login and authentication mechanisms.

### Token-Based Authentication
- Use of session IDs and tokens for authentication.
- Token generation, validation, and expiration.

### Secure Communication
- Ensuring secure communication via HTTPS.
- Storing sensitive data securely and minimizing exposure.

### Error Handling
- Managing failed login attempts.
- Providing informative yet secure error messages.

## Requirements
### General
- All code will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.10).
- All files must end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file is mandatory.
- Code should be PEP 8 compliant.
- Modules and functions must be documented.
- You are not allowed to use `var` for JavaScript-based components.

### Project-Specific
- You must use bcrypt for password hashing.
- JSON will be the data format for communication between the client and server.
- Use Flask or a similar framework for the back-end service.
